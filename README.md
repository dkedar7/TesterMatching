# TesterMatching
Tester-matching algorithm is one of the major features of the Applause platform. When particular criteria are selected according to a Customer's needs, this algorithm comes up with a list of testers, sorted by the most qualified, using a stored tester database. This repository holds the code for a Python (Flask)-based web application to demonstrate the tester-matching algorithm. At its heart, the app matches given selection criteria with the database, queries relevant results, sorts them by their qualifications, and displays them in a tabulated manner. <br> <br>
